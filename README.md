# Homework-4-Code-Quiz
# Introduction
The point of this homework is create a quiz on Javascript with the use of Jquery and multiple functions, as well as loops, arrays and objects. Accessing all of this information and bringing it together with CSS, so that it looks like the example given in the demo. 

### What I learnt?
I picked up many things along the way when trying to complete this task, trying to figure how to get the time to work on this particular assignment was difficult.This wasthe hardest for me, as I had to figure how to use the users repsonse to minus time from the clock. Using JavaScript to access the DOM, was difficult, when carrying out this homework, as it is still very new to me. In addition to this I had to add buttons to this quiz so that the correct answer could be selected, as well giving it a icon and colour if it was chosen incorrectly. This homework assignment was the most diffuclt one yet as, when writing the functions, if it was incorrect it would throw the whole file out.
#### For the future
I would like to go over everything we have done in class so far and really come to grips with what was used and when carrying out this task, to really digest everything. Especially the use of the DOM and JQuery, as mentioned above, because it is still very new to me. I hope you like my quiz.
